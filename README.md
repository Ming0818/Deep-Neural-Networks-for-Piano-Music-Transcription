# Deep Neural Networks for Piano Music Transcription

DT2119 Speech and Speaker Recognition course's project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

## Abstract

In this project the main approaches of Automatic Music Transcription using Neural Networks are reviewed and explained. As an experimental study to these approaches, different models of Neural Networks are proposed to be compared for the application of Polyphonic Piano Music Transcription. This experimentation is first focused on the dataset preprocessing and alignment and is continued by a empirical comparison between Deep Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks performances. The objective of the current project is to serve as a first step for future Neural Network design and optimization for Automatic Music Transcription by enclosing the best combination of methods and parameters for this particular task.
